# PROJECT #1 - COWABUNGA SURF AND BEACH FINDER APPLICATION

## CONCEPT

This project was designed for the purpose of providing a one-stop application to simplify and expedite the planning and research process that comes with the customized evaluation of beaches in your area.  Due to the fact that prospective beach-goers and surfers require a lot of information before deciding which beach to visit, we were able to bridge that information gap to provide a real-time snapshot of beach conditions and amenities for any beach that the user is considering.  During this unprecedented time, it is more important than ever to take the proper precautions and perform the necessary steps to ensure the health and safety of you and your family.  This application greatly assists the user in this endeavor.

## USAGE

This application utilized four APIs: Google, Coastal Commission, Weather, and StormGlass in order to produce a unique user experience across three website pages.  In the home/landing page, the user simply needs to enter their zip code or city, and the app calls the Google API and returns the 20 closest beaches to their specified area in a search results page.  We have also provided three featured beaches on the landing page that may be selected to take the user directly to the information display page (in the case where the beach the user would like to visit matches one of our featured beaches).  

Upon landing on the search results page, the user will given a choice of the 20 closest beaches to their area, including the title and image of the beach.  Once the user selects one of the provided options, they will be navigated to the information display page for their selected beach where they will be presented with enhanced features such as the weather of the area, amenities of the beach, and surfing conditions, along with the title and beach image.

## PROCESS

            Local Storage (Tristan/Andrew)

## CHALLENGES

There were a few front-end styling issues which took some time to resolve.  Among those challenges were handling hover grow overflow, grid configuration problems, and beach images inexplicably shifting.  The back-end team also experienced the challenges of learning how the different APIs functioned, as well as determining the logic necessary to execute the app.                   

## SUCCESSES

Our successes were overcoming all of the challenges mentioned above and successfully executing a well-designed app that is both highly unique and useful.  We were very collaborative and communicated well.  We held scrum meetings before starting work on a daily basis to collectively share what we worked on the day before, what we would be working on that day, and any problems that we were facing.  By doing this daily, we were able to stay on top of issues and to proactively discuss potential challenges that may be coming down the road.  We were also able to utilize Agile methodology to complete small concept pieces of the project in order to test functionality and verify design.

## DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

The groundwork has been laid, but there are several enhancements that could greatly improve the user experience:

Utilization of graphs/visuals
Weather/Surf conditions forecasts
Real-time parking and crowd levels
Real-time beach news and updates
Coast Guard/Lifeguard information
COVID Regulations
Real-time beach images
