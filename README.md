# PROJECT #1 - COWABUNGA SURF AND BEACH FINDER APPLICATION

## USAGE

This project was designed for the purpose of providing a one-stop application to simplify and expedite the planning and research process that comes with the customized evaluation of beaches in your area.  Due to the fact that prospective beach-goers and surfers require a lot of information before deciding which beach to visit, we were able to bridge that information gap to provide a real-time snapshot of beach conditions and amenities for any beach that the user is considering.

This application utilized four APIs: Google Maps, Coastal Commission, Weather, and StormGlass in order to produce a unique user experience across three website pages.  In the home/landing page, the user simply needs to enter their zip code or city, and the app calls the Google API and returns the 20 closest beaches to their specified area in a search results page.  We have also provided three featured beaches on the landing page that may be selected to take the user directly to the information display page (in the case where the beach the user would like to visit matches one of our featured beaches).  

Upon landing on the search results page, the user will given a choice of the 20 closest beaches to their area, including the title and image of the beach.  Once the user selects one of the provided options, they will be navigated to the information display page for their selected beach where they will be presented with enhanced features such as the weather of the area, amenities of the beach, and surfing conditions, along with the title and beach image.
